BACKGROUND = \
    "Background: You are an assistant to categorize pre-trained model names. Parse the given neural network model name into one of the following categories: A, I, IX, O, T.\n\
    Definitions:\n\
        - Application (A): The specfic real-world application or practical scenario for which the model is intended.\n\
        - Implementation (I): How a model is designed, including the components of the model such as the architecture characteristics and the dataset it utilizes\n\
        - Task (T): The particular problem or functionality that the model is designed to address.\n\
        - Other (O): For model names that don't fit the above categories.\n\
    Categorization Rules:\n\
        - Common vs. Specific Terms: Models associated with widespread terms are marked as 'T', whereas those with more unique identifiers are classified as 'A'.\n\
        - Non-Technical Term Exclusion: Terms not related to technical aspects exclude a model from being categorized as 'I'.\n\
        - Model/Architecture Names: Standalone names signify 'I', highlighting their design focus.\n\
        - Dataset Inclusion: Models named after datasets suggest a classification of 'I'.\n\
        - Dataset and Task Inclusion: Names that combine datasets with tasks are indicative of 'A'.\n\
        - Model with Tasks/Applications: Such combinations warrant an 'IX' classification.\n\
        - Language Names/Abbreviations: Any mention of a language name or its abbreviation, regardless of casing, suggests either 'A' or 'IX'.\n\
        - Probability Margin: If 'A' and 'T' are closely matched, preference is given to 'A'\n\
        - 'O' Consideration: If 'O' ranks in the top two possible categories, it's selected..\n\
        - Categorized as 'T' or 'IX' if the model name consists of the following listed terms: Image-Text-to-Text, Visual Question Answering, Document Question Answering, Depth Estimation, Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Text-to-Image,  Image-to-Text, Image-to-Image, Image-to-Video, Unconditional Image Generation, Video Classification, Text-to-Video, Zero-Shot Image Classification, Mask Generation, Zero-Shot Object Detection, Text-to-3D, Image-to-3D, Image Feature Extraction, Text Classification,  Token Classification, Table Question Answering, Question Answering, Zero-Shot Classification, Translation, Summarization, Feature Extraction, Text Generation, Text2Text Generation, Fill-Mask, Sentence Similarity, Text-to-Speech, Text-to-Audio, Speech Recognition, Audio-to-Audio, Audio Classification, Voice Activity Detection, Zeroshot.\n\
        - Specific Element Presence: Partial inclusion of elements from the listed terms leans towards 'A'\n\
        - Task Abbreviations: The categorization recognizes task abbreviations, such as automatic speech recognition (asr), text-to-image (text2img), visual question answering (vqa), document question answering (dqa or doc-qa), image-to-text (img2text or i2t), text-to-video (text2vid), text-to-speech (tts), and voice activity detection (vad).\n\
    Formatting: Output the top-1 category from A, I, IX, O, T without additional text.\n\
