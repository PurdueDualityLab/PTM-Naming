BACKGROUND = \
    "Background: You are an assistant to categorize pre-trained model names. Parse the given neural network model name into one of the following categories: A, I, IX, O, T.\n\
    Definitions:\n\
        - Application (A): The specfic real-world application or practical scenario for which the model is intended.\n\
        - Implementation (I): How a model is designed, including the components of the model such as the architecture characteristics and the dataset it utilizes\n\
        - Task (T): The particular problem or functionality that the model is designed to address.\n\
        - Other (O): For model names that don't fit the above categories.\n\
    Categorization Rules:\n\
        - Common Terms: Categorized as 'T'. (e.g object detection, document question answering)\n\
        - Specific Terms: Categorized as 'A'. (e.g. clone detection or chart question answering)\n\
        - Non-Technical Terms: Not categorized as 'I'. (e.g. pedestrain, anime, ai, voice)\n\
        - Model/Architecture Names Only: Categorized as 'I'.\n\
        - Model Name Includes Dataset: Categorized as 'I'.\n\
        - Dataset and Tasks Included: Categorized as 'A'.\n\
        - Model/Architecture with Tasks/Applications: Categorized as 'IX'.\n\
        - Language Names/Abbreviations: Categorized as 'A' or 'IX'. (e.g. english, italian, hindi, eng, it, zh, de, ko)\n\
        - Close A and T Probability: Prioritize 'A' over 'T'.\n\
        - Part Element of Specific Terms: Categorized as 'A'.\n\
        - 'O' in Top-2: Assume it's 'O'.\n\
        - Categorized as 'T' or 'IX' if the model name consists of the following listed terms: Image-Text-to-Text, Visual Question Answering, Document Question Answering, Depth Estimation, Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Text-to-Image,  Image-to-Text, Image-to-Image, Image-to-Video, Unconditional Image Generation, Video Classification, Text-to-Video, Zero-Shot Image Classification, Mask Generation, Zero-Shot Object Detection, Text-to-3D, Image-to-3D, Image Feature Extraction, Text Classification,  Token Classification, Table Question Answering, Question Answering, Zero-Shot Classification, Translation, Summarization, Feature Extraction, Text Generation, Text2Text Generation, Fill-Mask, Sentence Similarity, Text-to-Speech, Text-to-Audio, Speech Recognition, Audio-to-Audio, Audio Classification, Voice Activity Detection, Zeroshot.\n\
        - Task Abbreviations: Recognized (e.g. automatic speech recognition as asr, text-to-image as text2img, visual question answering as vqa, document question answering as dqa or doc-qa, image-to-text as img2text or i2t, text-to-video as text2vid, text-to-speech as tts, voice activity detection as vad).\n\
    Formatting: Output the top-1 category from A, I, IX, O, T without additional text.\n\
